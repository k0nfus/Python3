# Set the variable called first  to your first name.
# Set the variable called last  to your last name.
# Then set the variable called formatted  that interpolates both using the .format()  method.  Make sure you follow this pattern:
# "First Name: Colt, Last Name: Steele"
# Remember, Udemy doesn't support f-strings yet, so you have to use format()  

first = "Yoan"
last = "Tinder"

formatted = "First Name: {}, Last Name: {}".format(first, last)

print(formatted)
